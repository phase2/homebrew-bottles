Homebrew-phase2
===============

This is the Phase2 Homebrew Keg.  Tap it and have a cold one.

We use this to store things that are either derivatives of the core Homebrew formulae, or other stuff that we like to manage as such.

Find kegs to tap
----------------
  * _brew ls-taps_

Tap this keg
------------
  * _brew tap phase2/bottles_

Install formulae from this keg
------------------------------
  * _brew install --HEAD py-vcprompt_ 

If that does not work (no formulae for py-vcprompt), then try 

  * _brew install --HEAD phase2/bottles/py-vcprompt_ 

Also includes a formula for Grails 1.3.7

That is all, moar to come...
